\begin{document}
	
	I am grateful to the reviewers for their comments on the revised version of this manuscript. 
	
	\Reviewer{\#1}
	
	I corrected the typo indicated by the reviewer whom I thank for their precise indications. The main comment I wish to answer is the last one:
	\begin{response}
		{The complexity $O(P ^2 log P+ ...)$ is wrong. The complexity is proportional to the bandwidth.}
	\end{response}	
	I don't understand why the formula is wrong, however, I acknowledge  that I did not provide details on how I obtained this formula. The complexity indicated in the reference is 
	\[O( |I_N| \log |I_N| + \cdots)\,,\]
	where, as far as I understand,  $|I_N|$  stands for an upper bound of the largest frequency appearing in the transform. Here, the largest frequency is $\rho_P \approx \pi P = O(P).$ This term is thus negligible compared to the remaining terms in the complexity. I included those details in the revised version of the manuscript and hope that the matter is now clearer. 
	
	\Reviewer{\#2}
	
	I wish to thank the second reviewer for his encouraging comments on my manuscript. I incorporated his suggestions to the revised versions.
