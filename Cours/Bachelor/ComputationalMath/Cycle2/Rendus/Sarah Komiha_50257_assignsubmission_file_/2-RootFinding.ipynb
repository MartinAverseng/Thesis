We discuss numerical methods to approximate solutions of this kind of problems to an arbitrarily high accuracy. First, we formalize the notion of convergence and order of convergence for **iterative methods**. Then, we focus on three iterative algorithms approximating roots of functions: **bisection method**, **fixed point iterations** and **Newton Raphson method**. These methods are described, analysed and used to solve 3 problems coming from physics, finance and dynamics of population."

It depends on two parameters: $\\beta$ and $\\delta$, the average numbers of births and deaths per individual and unit of time.

    "> Brouwer is a Dutch mathematician and philosopher. He proved a lot of results in topology. One of his main theorem is his fixed point theorem (1909). One of its simpler form says that a continuous function from an interval to itself has a fixed point. The proof of the theorem does not provide a method to compute the corresponding fixed point. Among lot of other fixed point results, Brouwer's theorem became very famous because of its use in various fields of mathematics or in economics. In 1922, a polish mathematician, Stefan Banach, stated a contraction mapping theorem, proving in some case the existence of a unique fixed point and providing a constructive iterative method to approximate these fixed points. Banach is one of the founders of modern analysis and is often considered as one of the most important mathematicians of the 20-th century."

    "> English mathematician, astronomer, theologian, author and physicist, Isaac Newton is known as one of the most important scientists. He made breaking contributions to classical mechanics, optic and also contributed to infinitesimal calculus. In particular, he described in an unpulished work in 1671 a method to find zeros of polynomials now known as the Newton-Raphson method. Indeed, it was first published (with a reference to Newton) by another english mathematician, Joseph Raphson in 1690. Newton finally published his analysis in 1736. Both of them focused on zeros of polynomial functions but the basis of the general method was already present in their works."
