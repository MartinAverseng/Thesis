    "In this chapter, we introduce the fundamental notion of **approximation**, which is the basis of Computational Mathematics. Approximation induces errors that have to be controlled. We focus on two kinds of errors: **round-off errors** due to machine representation of numbers and **truncation errors** due to mathematical approximation. Through examples, we show that mathematical analysis allows to study the behavior of errors and we introduce the notions of **convergence** and **speed of convergence**.\n"

    "For sufficiently big values of $h$, the error is dominated by the truncation error: we observe the convergence to zero of the error with order $1$ or $2$ depending on the algorithm. Then, below a given value of $h$, the round-off error becomes dominant and the total error increase... One has to be aware of such behaviors to be able to chose efficiently the discretization parameters."

    ">Brook Taylor is an english mathematician and was also musician and painter artist. He is best known for the so-called Taylor's theorem and Taylor series that can be found in its book *Methodus incrementorum directa et inversa* (without rest nor convergence result) . In this book, one can also found the integration by parts formula and the prinicples of finite differences. It remained quite unknown until the italian mathematician and astronomer Joseph-Louis Lagrange discoverd its importance in 1772, to the point of considering Taylor's work to be the *foundation of differential calculus*.
