    "In this chapter, we introduce the fundamental notion of **approximation**, which is the basis of Computational Mathematics. Approximation induces errors that have to be controlled. We focus on two kinds of errors: **round-off errors** due to machine representation of numbers and **truncation errors** due to mathematical approximation. Through examples, we show that mathematical analysis allows to study the behavior of errors and we introduce the notions of **convergence** and **speed of convergence**.\n",
