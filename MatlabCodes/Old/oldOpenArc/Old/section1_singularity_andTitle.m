%% Solving the Dirichlet problem for the Laplacian outside a open arc. 
% Our aim is to solve the boundary value problem $\Delta u = 0$ with given
% Dirichlet data on an open line in $R^2$. The solution has a singularity
% near the tips of the arc causing difficulties for numerical resolution.
% We show a method of resolution using a weighted version of the single
% layer potential and a preconditioner for the system based on an analysis
% when the arc is the open segment $\Gamma = (-1,1)$. This preconditioner
% involves the square root of a weighted version of the Laplace operator. 

%% 1Â°) Singularity of the solution
% We first create the curve, which is the $\Gamma = [-1,1]$ segment.
% _segment_ is an object of type "simpleCurve", containing the parametric
% representation of the curve

% Say we want to solve the Dirichlet scattering problem
% That is, let an incident field $u_i$ with $\Delta u_i = 0$ in all $\bf{R}^2$. Let us
% choose an incident wave that is constant.

u_i = R2toRfunc(1);

% The scattered field $u$ satisfies $\Delta u = 0$ with $u = -u_i$ prescribed
% on both sides of the segment. Then, the scattered field is equal to
% $S\lambda$ where $\lambda$ is the jump of normal derivatives of $u$ across
% $\Gamma$ and $S$ is the single layer potential.
% On the segment, this translates to $S\lambda = - u_i$. Let us assemble the
% single layer potential. Here, the variable _S_ is an object that contains
% a method for the matrix product evaluation on each vector, without
% storing the actual coefficients of the matrix. The linear system is
% solved using Krylov method (GMRES).
% For a function $u$ defined on $\Gamma$, the secondMember routine returns
% the linear form l with coefficients
%
% $$l_i = \int_{\Gamma} u(x) \phi_i(x).$$
%
% Those coefficients are obtained via Gaussian quadratures.

S = singleLayer(k,Vh,[],{'a_factor',5}); % By default, we set the evalutation points of the
% Single layer on the gauss points of Vh. The a_factor parameter allows one
% to control the proportion of 'close' vs 'far' interactions.
