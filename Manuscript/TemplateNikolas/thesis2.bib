abstract="The fundamental definition of an H-selfadjoint matrix A has been introduced in the preceding chapter. Also, in Section 4.5, it has been shown that pairs (A, H) of this kind can be divided into equivalence classes under the relation of ``unitarily similarity''. Thus, pairs (A1, H1) and (A2, H2) of this kind are in the same equivalence class if there is a matrix T such that                                                           {\$}{\$}A{\_}1  = T^{\{} - 1{\}} A{\_}2 T{\$}{\$}             and                                                           {\$}{\$}H{\_}1  = T^* H{\_}2 T{\$}{\$}             or, what is the same, there is a simultaneous congruence H1 = T*H2T and H1A1 = T*(H2A2)T. The first objective of this chapter is the description of canonical pairs in these equivalence classes. As one might expect, this investigation reveals important invariants of unitary similarity and, in particular, the notion of the ``sign characteristic'' of an equivalence class is found to be important. Indeed, three different characterizations of this notion are to be developed here. The stability of the sign characteristic under perturbations is also investigated.",

abstract="Being able to analyze programs function by function, or module by module is a key ingredient to scalable static analyses. The main difficulty for modular static analysis is to be able to do so while not losing too much precision. In this paper, we present a new summary-based approach that builds on previous work of the authors, a zonotopic functional abstraction, that is economical both in space and time complexity. This approach has been implemented, and experiments on numerical programs, reported here, show that this approach is very efficient, and that we still obtain precise analyses in realistic cases.",

  abstract	= {<p>This book represents the first synthesis of the
		  considerable body of new research into positive definite
		  matrices. These matrices play the same role in
		  noncommutative analysis as positive real numbers do in
		  classical analysis. They have theoretical and computational
		  uses across a broad spectrum of disciplines, including
		  calculus, electrical engineering, statistics, physics,
		  numerical analysis, quantum information theory, and
		  geometry. Through detailed explanations and an
		  authoritative and inspiring writing style, Rajendra Bhatia
		  carefully develops general techniques that have wide
		  applications in the study of such matrices.</p><p>Bhatia
		  introduces several key topics in functional analysis,
		  operator theory, harmonic analysis, and differential
		  geometry--all built around the central theme of positive
		  definite matrices. He discusses positive and completely
		  positive linear maps, and presents major theorems with
		  simple and direct proofs. He examines matrix means and
		  their applications, and shows how to use positive definite
		  functions to derive operator inequalities that he and
		  others proved in recent years. He guides the reader through
		  the differential geometry of the manifold of positive
		  definite matrices, and explains recent work on the
		  geometric mean of several matrices.</p><p><em>Positive
		  Definite Matrices</em>is an informative and useful
		  reference book for mathematicians and other researchers and
		  practitioners. The numerous exercises and notes at the end
		  of each chapter also make it the ideal textbook for
		  graduate-level courses.</p>},

		  an ellipsoid method for linear programming can be
		  implemented in polynomial time. This result has caused
		  great excitement and stimulated a flood of technical
		  papers. Ordinarily there would be no need for a survey of
		  work so recent, but the current circumstances are obviously
		  exceptional. Word of Khachiyan's result has spread
		  extraordinarily fast, much faster than comprehension of its
		  significance. A variety of issues have, in general, not
		  been well understood, including the exact character of the
		  ellipsoid method and of Khachiyan's result on
		  polynomiality, its practical significance in linear
		  programming, its implementation, its potential
		  applicability to problems outside of the domain of linear
		  programming, and its relationship to earlier work. Our aim
		  is to help clarify these important issues in the context of
		  a survey of the ellipsoid method, its historical
		  antecedents, recent developments, and current research.},

		  pointed cone. This shows that in the special case of
		  order-preserving flows, a general characterization of the
		  contraction rate in Thompson's part metric, given by
		  Nussbaum, leads to an explicit formula. As an application,
		  we show that the flow of the generalized Riccati equation
		  arising in stochastic linear quadratic control is a local
		  contraction on the cone of positive definite matrices and
		  characterize its Lipschitz constant by a matrix inequality.
		  We also show that the same flow is no longer a contraction
		  in other invariant Finsler metrics on this cone, including
		  the standard invariant Riemannian metric. This is motivated
		  by a series of contraction properties concerning the
		  standard Riccati equation, established by Bougerol,
		  Liverani, Wojtkowski, Lawson, Lee and Lim: we show that
		  some of these properties do, and that some other do not,
		  carry over to the generalized Riccati equation. "

		  and its subsemigroup of symplectic Hamiltonian operators. A
		  canonical triple factorization is derived for the
		  symplectic Hamiltonian operators, and their closure under
		  multiplication is deduced from this property. This
		  semigroup of Hamiltonian operators, which we call the
		  symplectic semigroup, is studied from the viewpoint of Lie
		  semigroup theory, and resulting consequences for the theory
		  of the Riccati equation are delineated. Among other things,

		  existence of a solution of the Riccati equation for all t

abstract="Mathematical morphology is a very successful branch of image processing with a history of more than four decades. Its fundamental operations are dilation and erosion, which are based on the notion of a maximum and a minimum with respect to an order. Many operators constructed from dilation and erosion are available for grey value images, and recently useful analogs of these processes for matrix-valued images have been introduced by taking advantage of the so-called Loewner order. There has been a number of approaches to morphology for vector-valued images, that is, colour images based on various orders, however, each with its merits and shortcomings. In this article we propose an approach to (elementary) morphology for colour images that relies on the existing order based morphology for matrix fields of symmetric 2{\texttimes}2-matrices. An RGB-image is embedded into a field of those 2{\texttimes}2-matrices by exploiting the geometrical properties of the order cone associated with the Loewner order. To this end a modification of the HSL-colour model and a relativistic addition of matrices is introduced.",

abstract="The classical theoretical framework for static analysis of programs is abstract interpretation. Much of the power and elegance of that framework rests on the assumption that an abstract domain is a lattice. Nonetheless, and for good reason, the literature on program analysis provides many examples of non-lattice domains, including non-convex numeric domains. The lack of domain structure, however, has negative consequences, both for the precision of program analysis and for the termination of standard Kleene iteration. In this paper we explore these consequences and present general remedies.",

   abstract = {We present a scalable reachability algorithm for hybrid systems with piecewise affine, non-deterministic dynamics. It combines polyhedra and support function representations of continuous sets to compute an overapproximation of the reachable states. The algorithm improves over previous work by using variable time steps to guarantee a given local error bound. In addition, we propose an improved approximation model, which drastically improves the accuracy of the algorithm. The algorithm is implemented as part of SpaceEx, a new verification platform for hybrid systems, available at spaceex.imag.fr. Experimental results of full fixed-point computations with hybrid systems with more than 100 variables illustrate the scalability of the approach. }

abstract="John's ellipsoid criterion characterizes the unique ellipsoid of globally maximum volume contained in a given convex body C. In this article local and global maximum properties of the volume on the space of all ellipsoids in C are studied, where ultra maximality is a stronger version of maximality: the volume is nowhere stationary. The ellipsoids for which the volume is locally maximum, resp. locally ultra maximum are characterized. The global maximum is the only local maximum and for generic C it is an ultra maximum. The characterizations make use of notions originating from the geometric theory of positive quadratic forms. Part of these results generalize to the case where the ellipsoids are replaced by affine copies of a convex body D. In contrast to the ellipsoid case, there are convex bodies C and D, such that on the space of all affine images of D in C the volume has countably many local maxima. All results have dual counterparts. Extensions to the surface area and, more generally, to intrinsic volumes are mentioned.",

The objective of this analysis was to analyze functional and non-functional properties, but also to parameterize certain parts of the model based on the analysis results of other parts. In this article, we focus on results about the reachable state space of the voter, which prove the bounded-input bounded-output stability of the system, and the absence of arithmetic overflows.

(ii) If the primal is feasible, then it is bounded if and only if the dual is feasible. (iii) When the primal is feasible and bounded, then its optimum value equals that of the dual, or in other words, there is no duality gap. Further, the dual attains this common optimum value. (iv) It yields a precise theorem of the alternative for semidefinite inequality systems, i.e. a characterization of theinfeasibility of a semidefinite inequality in terms of thefeasibility of another polynomial size semidefinite inequality.",
